## Recommendations

1. **Add more tracking ID variations** - Users enter tracking IDs with spaces/hyphens
2. **Improve greeting handling** - Agent should not attempt delivery lookup on casual greetings
3. **Expand issue detection** - Add keywords for "delayed", "lost", "damaged"
4. **Increase cache TTL** - 62% hit rate is below 80% target
